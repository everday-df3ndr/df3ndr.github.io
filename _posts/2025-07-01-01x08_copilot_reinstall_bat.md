In this episode Koos returns to a somewhat controversial topic - **Security Copilot**, but this time without the hype and of course with some practical tips. Chris introduces **Microsoft Entra Suite** in the first of two episodes taking a look at these capabilities.

## Security Copilot

### Why did I say it's controversial?

* It seemed to burn through SCUs like candy. And these are expensive!
* I think there were some design flaws like lack of caching.

But there are some nice improvements!

* **Caching is here!** Previously, Copilot regenerated incident summaries every time‚Äîburning SCUs with each refresh. Also "incident report" stays in place as well as branched out investigations in dedicate Security Copilot portal.
* New "overage" SCUs make it more "pay-as-you-go".
* There are better visual insights into usage and costs.

### Cost structure

> Billing is calculated on hourly blocks based on provisioned capacity rather than by 60-minute increments and has a minimum of one hour. Any usage consumed within the same hour is billed as a full SCU for provisioned capacity, regardless of start or end times within that hour. For overage units, SCUs are billed up to one decimal increments for the exact consumed units. Consumed units are not rounded up to whole numbers. This means that you're charged precisely based on your usage (to one decimal place).
> For instance, if you provision an SCU at 9:05 a.m., then deprovision it at 9:35 am, and then provision another SCU at 9:45 am, you'll be charged for two units within the 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. hour. To maximize usage, make SCU provisioning changes at the beginning of the hour. For more information, see Manage usage.

### Practical tips

* You don‚Äôt have to keep it running 24/7.  
* Activate **Security Copilot temporarily** in your tenant and benefit from it across:
  * Microsoft Defender XDR
  * Microsoft Intune
  * Entra ID
* Once you‚Äôve gotten what you need‚Äîoffboard it again. No shame. Smart use of your SCU.
* Use my PowerShell script for easy on-/off-boarding. (since there are ZERO docs out there :-( ))

### Real-world scenarios

* **Defender XDR**

  Use Security Copilot directly inside an incident to:

  * *‚ÄúShow me the exact command line that was executed by this user in this incident.‚Äù*
  Copilot pulls relevant `ProcessCreationEvents`, extracts the command line, and summarizes the behavior‚Äîwithout clicking through multiple pivots.

  * *‚ÄúSummarize which lateral movement techniques were observed in this incident.‚Äù*
  Copilot parses incident evidence (like remote desktop usage, token theft, or SMB connections) and provides MITRE-aligned context.

* **Entra ID**

  Use natural queries to investigate identity-based activity:

  * *‚ÄúShow me the 10 most recent sign-ins for this user and summarize the MFA methods used.‚Äù*
  Copilot fetches sign-in logs, filters and aggregates sign-in frequency, location anomalies, and which MFA methods were used.

  * *‚ÄúSummarize all Conditional Access policies that apply to this user and describe their impact.‚Äù*
  No more digging through the CA policy blade‚ÄîCopilot gives you a readable breakdown of each rule, its scope, and enforcement logic.

* **Microsoft Intune**

  Security Copilot can help surface endpoint insights fast:

  * *‚ÄúWhich devices are non-compliant due to missing disk encryption?‚Äù*
  Copilot summarizes compliance policies and instantly lists affected devices.

  * *‚ÄúSummarize app risk posture across all Android BYOD devices.‚Äù*
  Copilot reviews app inventory and flags outdated, side-loaded, or unmanaged apps by device type.

### Final Thoughts

Security Copilot has come a long way. If you were burned by it early on‚Äîor avoided it due to cost‚Äîit might be time to **revisit and re-evaluate**.
But still be careful! SCU's are still burning down quickly and with an hourly rate of $4 ($6 for overage) this can quickly add up if you keep them running 24/7.

### PIM Role Advisor by Morten Knudsen

Morten shows us that AI doesn't need to be expensive. And in a fun way by integrating Azure AI Foundry with your PowerShell session.
Then with help of his script, PowerShell is advise you which Entra/Azure role you need based on an explanation you provide of the work you want to get done formulated in natural language.

With 77 requests in his demo he burned through 2 million tokens but payed only $ 0.23

[Check it out here and try it yourself](https://mortenknudsen.net/?p=5098) There's also [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbUJInHLBDc) of his script in action.

If you're not already following Morton, please do. He's probably the most hard-working community member I've ever met. He's cranking out different sessions at events, organizing Experts Live Denmark and still able to write blogs like these while also running a company.
